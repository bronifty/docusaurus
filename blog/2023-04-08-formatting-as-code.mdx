![Formatting as Code Python](/img/formatting-as-code-python.png)

There are 2 kinds of programming languages, which are differentiated by the way they handle block scoping.

1. Python style by indentation
2. C style by braces

I like to set clear boundaries with braces and allow you to do anything you want inside that boundary. Formatting as code is a stifling pedantic methodology which insults my ideals of freedom and creativity.

SQL is superior to C style languages because it doesn't even require formatting or braces; it requires you to put the clauses in proper order. This is a much more elegant solution to the problem of block scoping. All languages should strive to be like SQL.
