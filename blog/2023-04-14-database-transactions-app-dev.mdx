Database companies provide some of the best app tutorials. In a sense all apps are UIs that record transactions in a database. Whether it's a CRUD app or e-commerce, that database record is the source of truth. Further, it is the progenitor of physical activities. A record in a database will spawn physical work processes like shipping. Perhaps it could lead to further product creation, although that should be downstream from analytics which give insight into the most efficacious demand supply clearing equilibrium.
